        <h1>PSYCHOTHERAPY</h1>

        <h3>What is Psychotherapy?</h3>

    <p>The practice of psychotherapy involves a confidential, collaborative relationship with a psychotherapist. These relationships are built on trust, open and honest communication. This process creates a foundation for you to:
        <ul>
            <li>Gain a deeper understanding of your personal values, make sense of your experiences, understand your intra personal and interpersonal relationships and how your
                experiences shape your interpretation of the world</li>
            <li>Minimize emotional pain and decrease anxiety and depression</li>
            <li>Reduce distressing or self-defeating psychological and emotional patterns that interfere with your goals in life</li>
            <li>Develop adaptive coping strategies to help deal with stress and anxiety</li>
            <li>Improve communication skills that can result in more satisfying interpersonal relationships</li>
            <li>Gain a sense of control over your life and live in a more gratifying and fulfilling life</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    </div>

    <p>Psychotherapy can provide you with a better understanding of the choices you’ve made and how these
        choices can may have impacted your current circumstances.  This deeper understanding of self can
        result in making heathier choice and personal satisfaction.   .
        My philosophy is that psychotherapist must create a  warm and supportive environment which enables clients to  feel safe so that they can voice, process and address their concerns. Celebrating the uniqueness of each person, I incorporate components from a wide variety of models of psychotherapy in my practice so that each client has a “tailor made” approach to treatment. My approaches involve but is not limited to Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), Psychodynamic Therapy, Solution Focus Therapy, Experiential Therapy, Feminist Therapy, Person Centred Therapy, Strength Based Approaches and Psychodynamic Therapy. </p>

        <h3>How long does psychotherapy take?</h3>

        <p>The duration of therapy depends on the complexity of your concerns and the goals that you want to achieve. Usually, most goals can be achieved in 8-12 sessions. Such short-term therapies usually involve learning and practicing new effective coping skills, such as crisis management, relaxation training and learning how to identify and challenge negative thought patterns.
            Some clients set therapeutic goals that require a longer course of psychotherapy. These clients might have complex and multiple emotional and psychological concerns. Such concerns might take more time and effort to unpack, process and address.  This approach will result in greater understanding of self, awareness of behavior patterns, better crisis management and improved quality of life.
            <br>
            Regardless of the type of therapy that you choose, I will collaborate to ensure that you meet your goals.
            </p>

        <h3>Thought about Medication</h3>

        <p>I take a holistic approach to health and wellness, which means that I will support your choices around medication.  I will collaborate with your health providers to ensure that you receive the best care.
